# performOperationByObjectKey
This API allows to set values and apply operations over the game-developer-created set of attributes that are specified
in the "attributes" section of the JSON file when a new Game-Object is created by providing its unique object Key ID
and Attribute Key ID.
This API allows to modify only those attributes of a Game-Object that are specified in the "attributes" section of 
a Game-Object.
In order to directly modify the automatically inherited set of attributes outside the "attributes" section of a 
Game-Object, please refer to the [Game Manager] set of APIs.

## Example updating a Game-Object attribute by providing its unique Key ID and Attribute Key ID:

curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"attributeKey":"attr1","value":"5","operation":"+"}' http://faars-rocketfuel.javakafe.com/who_is_the_rooster/rooster1/operations/ObjectKeyTest
