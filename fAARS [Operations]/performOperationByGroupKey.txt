# performOperationByGroupKey
This API allows to set values and apply operations over the game-developer-created set of attributes that are specified
in the "attributes" section of the JSON file when a new Game-Object is created by providing a Group Key ID
and Attribute Key ID.
This API allows to modify only those attributes of a Game-Object that are specified in the "attributes" section of 
a Game-Object.
In order to directly modify the automatically inherited set of attributes outside the "attributes" section of a 
Game-Object, please refer to the [Game Manager] set of APIs.

## Example updating a set of Game-Objects attribute by providing a Group Key ID and Attribute Key ID:

curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"attributeKey":"attr1","value":"5","operation":"+"}' http://faars-zenfri.javakafe.com/clandestine_anomaly/clandestine1/operations/groups/group2


* Receives a JSON file via PUT method:
{
	"attributeKey":"attr1", (Attribute Key. It can take any value. A value is required)
	"value":"5", (Value to be used in the operation. It can take any value. A value is required)
	"operation":"+" (The operation to be performed. It can only take '+', '-', '/', '*', or 'set' as values. A value is required)
}
